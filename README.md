# Analysis of Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the relative success of theater Kickstarter campaigns in meeting their funding goals in relation to the date of campaign launch and overall funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To determine the relative success of theater campaigns as a function of launch date, outcome data from all theater-related campaigns over a multi-year period were examined to provide numbers of campaigns that either met their funding goal, failed to meet their funding goal, or were canceled. The data was then broken out to provide these statistics by month of year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To determine the relative success of theater campaigns as a function of funding goal, outcome data from campaigns identified as “Plays” over a multi-year period were identified as either successfully meeting their goal, failing to meet their goal, or having been canceled. For the analysis, funding goals were grouped by ranges and percentages of campaigns meeting the aforementioned criteria were calculated.

## Results
-In evaluating the campaign outcomes of based on the launch date, the data suggests that higher numbers of campaigns that successfully meet their funding goals are associated with launches that occur during the spring and summer months. We also see that, in general, more campaigns are launched during the spring and summer months, so analyzing relative percentages of successful and failed campaigns over this period may provide a valuable piece of data.[

-In looking at campaign outcomes as a function of funding goal, the data suggests that high levels of funding success (73%) are seen with campaigns with funding goals of $5,000 or less. Levels of success and failure are roughly equivalent with campaign goals between $5,000 and $25,000. As campaign goals exceed $25,000, the percentage of failed campaigns tends to increase, though the data shows a higher percentage of successful campaigns at goal levels of $35,000 to $45,000. It is important to note that the number of total campaigns at this $35,000 to $45,000 goal level is relatively low, so the success or failure of a single campaign can dramatically impact overall success and failure figures. 

## Dataset Limitations
-When analyzing data for theater outcomes based on launch date, all subcategories under the theater parent category were included in the analysis, while only data related to the “Plays” subcategory were utilized in the outcomes based on goals analysis.

-Regarding the data of outcomes based on goals, small sample sizes associated with higher-goal campaigns could potentially impact percentages in a significant way

## Other Possible Tables and Graphs
-Another table we could create would be evaluating outcomes vs. funding goal as a function of month of launch. We may find that an increased number of campaigns with specific funding goals successfully meet those goals when launches occur in specific months of the year, providing potentially valuable guidance on either where to set goals or when to launch campaigns.
-We could also generate a chart for theater outcomes by launch date that include only data from the “plays” subcategory. That may allow for a more focused conclusion when looking at both sets of data.
